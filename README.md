# Covid-19-Data-Analytics-Part-Two
 This project focuses on building a data analytics solution for death risk prediction relating to COVID-19. The dataset used is from the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC). 

This project is broken down into 5 main parts:

- The dataset from part one will be prepared again using the data quality plan as provided by the module coordinator.
- The dataset from part one will be reviewed and we will decide on which features to use to build our model
- We will create a Linear Regression model and analyse
- We will create a Logistic Regression model and analyse
- We will create a Random Forest model and analyse
- We will then try to optimize each model and find the one which performs best at predicting the target feature.
